title: Hello Hexo

It takes me sometime to finish the first deployment, not sure why github page cannot update with the master branch which it used to be able to. Anyway, I changed deployment to heroku. Following is a example tutorial from hexo to deploy your first hexo site.

## Quick Start

### Create a new post

``` bash
$ hexo new "My New Post"
```

### Run server

``` bash
$ hexo server
```

More info: [Server](https://hexo.io/docs/server.html)

### Generate static files

``` bash
$ hexo generate
```

### Deploy to remote sites

``` bash
$ hexo deploy
```
