It's been almost two years since I decided to study computer science and transfered to UCF. Still remember the first day I came to UCF, a roommate drove me to the campus, I barely spoke English, a little bit scared and a little bit excited. The first time talked to a adviosr, I can only understand thirty percent of the content. Anyway, things are getting better now, I'm going to graduate in next year, summer or fall, depends on getting an internship or not, hopefully everything can work out smoothly. After few nights can't fall in sleep, I decided to knock things down on my blog, including the thougts and my works, to kill the time and have fun.
